This is a code for parsing regular expressions (regexes).

Any lowercase letter is an regex.
0 and 1 are regexes.
If a and b are regexes, then a+b, ab, a* and (a) are also regexes.
Any number of spaces can appear between two symbols.
Any other string is not a regex.

Code checks whether a given string is a regex and if it is, it simplifize it.
For example (( 0***a 1(b)+0ab*) )* will be changed to (ab)*.

Input should be in format:
Number of tests
Number of strings in text
Strings (every one in seperate line).
